## Movie App Project

The application team recently worked with an entertainment company specializing in streaming online media content to create a movie application. The movie app project used React components, router redirects, Firebase backend, and data pulled from an API with Axios.

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Sule-Ss/movie-app-with-react)
- [Requirements Gathering](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11J3PLi_lxMLwQo3EYkwIn_NQOdFA3hFcKvUAmc0bSTU/edit#gid=0)
- [Jira Board](https://sctp-cloud-cohort2-group3.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/GCP/boards/1)

The application was containerized using Docker and deployed to AWS Elastic Container Service.

![containerisation_workflow](./assets/containerisation_workflow.png)
### Cloning the Repository to Your Local Environment

![git-clone](./assets/git_clone.png)
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Sule-Ss/movie-app-with-react.git
cd movie-app-with-react
code .
```

### Create Dockerfile
![dockerfile-sample](./assets/create-dockerfile1.png)
```Dockerfile
# Use a base image
FROM node:14 as build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the appâ€™s files
COPY . .

# Build the React app
RUN npm run build

# Use a smaller base image for serving the app
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build files to the nginx directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start the nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

## Docker Commands
1. Open Docker Desktop and sign in.

2. Go back to your VS Code.

3. Build the Docker image with a tag (name) for the image:
```
docker build -t movie-app-image .
```
(The -t flag is used to tag or name the Docker image that is being built.)

4. Run the Docker container, mapping port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container, and run it in detached mode:
```
docker run -p 8080:80 -d movie-app-image
```
(The -p flag is used to map or publish ports between the host and the container. For example, port 80 within the container will be mapped to port 8080 on the host machine. The -d flag is used to run a container in detached mode, which means the container runs in the background as a daemon process.)

5. Once you can deploy locally, you can proceed to deploy it on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS).

6. Build the Docker image again with the same tag (if needed) to ensure you have the latest image locally:
```
docker build -t movie-app-image .
```
7. The Docker image will be pushed to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Ensure you are signed in to your AWS account via a web browser.

8. Obtain an ECR login password for the specified AWS region and log in to ECR using Docker:
```
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-southeast-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 255945442255.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com
```

## Create a Repository in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
1. Next, you need to create a repository in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) where you can store your Docker image.
2. 
![ECR1](./assets/ECR1.png)

3. Enter a unique name for your repository in the ECR console.

![ECR2](./assets/ECR2.png)

## Tag Docker Image with Amazon Elastic Container Registry
After creating the repository, you'll need to tag your Docker image with the ECR repository URL and a specific tag (e.g., "latest"). This is necessary for pushing the image to ECR.
```
docker tag movie-app-image:latest 255945442255.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/movie-app-image:latest
```
(Replace "movie-app-image" with your image name and "latest" with your desired tag if different.)

## Push Image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
Now that your Docker image is tagged correctly, you can push it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) using the following command:
```
docker push 255945442255.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/movie-app-image:latest
```

## Terraform Configuration for Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
The deployment of your container to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) will be orchestrated using Terraform. You will need to create a Terraform configuration file in your Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment. Below is the Terraform code for configuring your ECS setup:

![terraform1](./assets/terraform1.png)

```Terraform.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-southeast-1" # Modify this with your desired AWS region
}

locals {
  application_name = "movie-app-image" # Replace with your application name
}

resource "aws_ecs_task_definition" "my_task_definition" {
  family                   = local.application_name
  network_mode             = "awsvpc"
  requires_compatibilities = ["FARGATE"]
  execution_role_arn      = "arn:aws:iam::255945442255:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole" # Replace with your execution role ARN

  container_definitions = jsonencode([
    {
      name  = local.application_name
      image = "255945442255.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/movie-app-image:latest" # Modify with your ECR image URL
      portMappings = [
        {
          containerPort = 8080
          hostPort      = 8080
          protocol      = "tcp"
        }
      ]
      essential = true
    }
  ])

  cpu    = "512"
  memory = "1024"
}

resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "my_ecs_cluster" {
  name = "${local.application_name}-cluster"
}

resource "aws_ecs_service" "my_ecs_service" {
  name            = "${local.application_name}-service"
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.my_ecs_cluster.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.my_task_definition.arn
  launch_type     = "FARGATE"

  network_configuration {
    subnets          = ["subnet-04056e91a09a5b4bf", "subnet-bea677f6", "subnet-29ed7170"] # Modify with your subnet IDs
    assign_public_ip = true
    security_groups = ["sg-b4db57fc"] # Modify with your security group IDs
  }

  scheduling_strategy = "REPLICA"
  desired_count       = 1
  platform_version    = "LATEST"
  deployment_controller {
    type = "ECS"
  }
  deployment_maximum_percent = 200
  deployment_minimum_healthy_percent = 100
  enable_ecs_managed_tags = true
}
```

Commands used:
- terraform init
- terraform plan
- terraform apply

# GitHub Actions for Automation

The deployment of your application using Terraform scripts will be automated via GitHub Actions.

![githubactions](./assets/githubactions.png)

## Setting Up GitHub Actions Workflow

Inside your repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory and add a YAML file for your workflow. Name it something like `deploy-movie-app.yml`.

```yaml
name: Deploy Movie App
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is doing CICD to deploy AWS ECS

on:
push:
 branches:
   - main

jobs:
deploy:
 name: Deploy Movie App
 runs-on: ubuntu-latest

 steps:
   - name: Checkout
     uses: actions/checkout@v3

   - name: Configure AWS credentials
     uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
     with:
       aws-access-key-id: ${{secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}
       aws-secret-access-key: ${{secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}
       aws-region: ap-southeast-1

   - name: Login to Amazon ECR
     id: login-ecr
     uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1

   - name: Build, tag, and push image to Amazon ECR
     id: build-image
     env:
       ECR_REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}
       ECR_REPOSITORY: movie-app-weiheng-test
       IMAGE_TAG: latest
     run: |
       # Build a Docker container and
       # push it to ECR so that it can
       # be deployed to ECS.
       docker build -t $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .
       docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
       echo "::set-output name=image::$ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG"

   - name: Initialize Terraform
     run: terraform init
     working-directory: .

   - name: Plan Terraform changes
     run: terraform plan
     working-directory: .

   - name: Apply Terraform changes
     run: terraform apply -auto-approve
     working-directory: .
```

Create secrets in your GitHub repository to store sensitive data like AWS access keys. Name them AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
![add_secrets](./assets/add_secrets.png)

## Running the GitHub Actions Workflow
To trigger the GitHub Actions workflow, use the following commands:

```
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
git push
```
Inside GitHub Actions, you can monitor the workflow's progress, debug any errors, and ensure that all steps are executed successfully.

**[Alert Rules Setup in Grafana Dashboard]**

To receive notifications in Grafana, you need to set up alerting rules
and configure notification channels. Grafana supports various
notification channels like email, Slack, PagerDuty, and more. Here\'s a
step-by-step guide on how to set up notifications in Grafana:

**[Prerequisites:]**

\- Ensure you have Grafana installed and configured.

\- Create a dashboard with the metrics you want to monitor.

**[Step 1: Configure Notification Channels]**

1\. Log in to your Grafana instance.

2\. Click on the three line icon
(![](./assets/image97.png)) in the left sidebar to access the
\"Configuration\" menu.

3\. Under \"Alerting,\" click on \"Contact points.\"

![](./assets/image35.png)

4\. Click the \"Add contact point\" button to create a new notification
channel.

![](./assets/image18.png)

5\. Name the contact points Select the type of notification channel you
want to set up (e.g., Email, Slack, or others). Each channel type has
its own configuration options.

![](./assets/image5.png)

**In our project, we selected Discord.**

6\. Configure the notification channel according to the selected type.
For example, if you\'re setting up email notifications, you\'ll need to
provide the SMTP server details and email addresses. If you\'re setting
up Slack/ Discord notifications, you\'ll need to provide a Slack/Discord
webhook URL.

![](./assets/image66.png)

7\. Save the notification channel configuration by clicking " save
contact point"
![](./assets/image11.png) after click on the " test
"![](./assets/image1.png) to verify the connection is ok. Following
shown the successful connection:

![](./assets/image31.png)

**[Step 2: Create Alerting Rules]**

1\. In Grafana, navigate to the dashboard where you want to set up
alerts.![](./assets/image25.png)

2\. Select which panel to set the rules.

![](./assets/image29.png)

3\. Click on "three dots" at the upper right corner.

![](./assets/image40.png)

4\. Click on the "edit" button.

![](./assets/image42.png)

5\. Select " Alert".

![](./assets/image78.png)

6\. Select " Create alert rule from this panel"

![](./assets/image39.png)

7\. Name the alert rules.

![](./assets/image7.png)

8\. Determine the query and alert condition.

![](./assets/image15.png)

9\. Determine the alert expression and set it as alert condition.

![](./assets/image19.png)

10\. Click on "Set as alert condition"
![](./assets/image34.png), green words alert condition
![](./assets/image84.png) will appear.

11\. Set alert evaluation behaviour. Select "Folder"
(**Capstone-Project-Dashboard**) and "Evaluation
group"(**Capstone-Project-Dashboard**), followed by "pending
period"(**=5m**).

\*create new evaluation group by clicking " **+new evaluation group**
"![](./assets/image47.png)![](./assets/image44.png)

**[Step 3: Test the Alert]**

To ensure that your alerting and notification setup is working
correctly, you can test it:

under Configuration notifications

1\. Click the \"preview routing" to see the notification policy is
routed to the selected contact points.

![](./assets/image6.png)

2\. Click on see details.

![](./assets/image20.png)

Routing details can be shown as below (example)

![](./assets/image54.png)

2\. Verify that you receive notifications through the configured
channels (e.g., email, Slack).

![](./assets/image46.png)

**[Step 4: Monitor and Adjust Alerts]**

After setting up alerts and notifications, monitor your Grafana
dashboard for alert triggers. When an alert condition is met, Grafana
will send notifications to the configured channels.

You can further adjust and fine-tune your alerts by modifying the alert
rules and conditions in Grafana\'s dashboard settings.

By following these steps, you can receive notifications in Grafana when
specific conditions are met, allowing you to proactively monitor and
respond to changes in your metrics and data.

> **[Things to improve:]**

1.  Create Cloudwatch alerts from Grafana dashboard directly instead of
    using SES.

2.  Create better customised dashboards to monitor the application.

3.  Automate creation of incident tickets directly in Jira when alert is
    triggered.
